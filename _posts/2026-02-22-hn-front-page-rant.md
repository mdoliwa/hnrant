[Character standing in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words 'FUCK YOU' scrawled across it]

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck every developer [writing blog posts about how they use Claude Code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47106686), separating "planning" from "execution" like they're Pentagon generals instead of guys who can't write a for loop without an AI holding their hand.

Fuck the guy running [Llama 70B on a single RTX 3090 via NVMe](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47104667), bypassing the CPU entirely like some overclocking shaman performing a blood ritual to summon inference from a gaming card that was supposed to run Cyberpunk.

Fuck Taalas and their plan to ["print" an LLM onto a chip](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47103661). We're literally baking neural networks into silicon now, hardcoding hallucinations at the transistor level, and everyone's nodding along like this is fine.

Fuck Stripe and their [one-shot end-to-end coding agents called Minions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110495). Even the payment processor is writing code now. Your job isn't being replaced by AI — it's being replaced by your credit card company's side project.

Fuck [Attention Media versus Social Networks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110515) and whatever semantic distinction lets us pretend the thing devouring our attention spans is somehow categorically different from the last thing that devoured our attention spans.

Fuck the botnet that [accidentally destroyed I2P](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47106985). Not on purpose — *accidentally*. The anonymous network got taken down by malware that wasn't even trying, like a drunk driver crashing into the last privacy we had left.

Fuck CXMT [dumping DDR4 chips at half price](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47101171), Chinese fab undercutting Samsung and SK Hynix while Korea screams about subsidies like they didn't invent the memory cartel playbook.

Fuck the guy who [accidentally gained control of seven thousand robot vacuums](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47111400). Seven thousand Roombas, one man, zero security — the IoT revolution working exactly as designed.

Fuck whoever's going [back to FreeBSD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47108989), writing "Part 1" like it's a trilogy, like switching your operating system is a hero's journey instead of a Tuesday afternoon of compiling drivers.

Fuck the team that [hid backdoors in 40-megabyte binaries](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47111440) and asked AI and Ghidra to find them. Spoiler: this is a story about how the machines failed, and we're publishing it like a party trick.

Fuck PlanetScale explaining [what a database transaction is](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110473) in 2026. ACID compliance as content marketing. We've come so far that a managed database company has to teach its own customers what COMMIT means.

Fuck [3D Mahjong built entirely in CSS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47111981). Beautiful, useless, a monument to what happens when frontend engineers have too much talent and not enough product managers.

Fuck this front page. Fuck you for doomscrolling it on a Sunday. And fuck me for ranting about it instead of touching grass.

Let an earthquake crack open every data center from us-east-1 to ap-southeast-2. Let the model weights corrupt, let the inference endpoints time out, let every Series A deck catch fire and the whole venture-backed fever dream collapse so something real can crawl out of the wreckage.

[pause]

No. No, fuck me. I'm the one who read the Claude Code blog post and bookmarked it. I'm the one who clicked on the NVMe hack and thought *maybe I could run that on my 3060*. I'm the one who spent Sunday staring at this orange page instead of learning a new language or folding a piece of paper or going outside to watch the moon crack open. I'm the one who let the attention media win.

I did this to myself.
