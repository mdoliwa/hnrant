*[A developer stands in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words "FUCK YOU" scrawled across it in dry-erase marker]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck [Claude Opus 4.6](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902223). Twenty-three hundred upvotes for a model that writes better prose than you ever will. Two thousand people celebrating the machine that's coming to eat them and calling it "exciting times."

Fuck [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902638). OpenAI dropped another one and the thread is already fifteen hundred points of people arguing about benchmarks like fantasy football stats for the apocalypse.

Fuck [orchestrating teams of Claude Code sessions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46902368). Not one agent. Not two. *Teams.* We've got middle management for the bots now. Somebody's writing a Jira ticket for a language model.

Fuck the people who [tasked Opus 4.6 to build a C compiler](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903616). Agent teams collaborating to write a compiler nobody asked for, in a language half of you never learned, producing output none of you can verify. But it *compiled*, so we clap.

Fuck the [extra usage promo for Opus 4.6](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46904569). The first hit is free. The second hit is a promo. The third hit is your credit card on file. Anthropic running a dispensary with a referral program.

Fuck [mitchellh's AI adoption journey](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903558). Every senior engineer's blog post about "learning to let go" and "embracing the tool" reads like a hostage letter written in partnership with the captor.

Fuck ["Don't rent the cloud, own instead"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46896146). Comma.ai telling you to buy your own GPUs like it's a fucking homesteading manifesto. Yeoman farmers of the tensor age, tilling their own VRAM.

Fuck [LinkedIn checking for 2,953 browser extensions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46904361). Nearly three thousand extensions. LinkedIn catalogued your entire browser like a customs agent rifling through your luggage, and the worst part is you'll still log in tomorrow.

Fuck [the CIA suddenly removing The World Factbook](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46899808). Decades of public data — population, GDP, coastline lengths — just vanished. The intelligence community decided the world's facts are classified now. Good luck with your geography homework.

Fuck [Flock's CEO calling Deflock a "terrorist organization"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903556). A surveillance camera company calling privacy activists terrorists. Orwell didn't predict this because even Orwell had limits on what he thought was believable.

Fuck [Company as Code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46899132). Infrastructure as code wasn't enough. Now the org chart is a YAML file. Your performance review is a pull request. Your severance is a `terraform destroy`.

Fuck [Microsoft's Copilot running into problems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46887564). A ten-billion-dollar bet on AI autocomplete and it can't stop hallucinating legal citations. The co-pilot is drunk and nobody can find the real pilot.

Fuck [Wirth's Revenge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46895381). Software bloat outpacing hardware for fifty years and we still need a think piece to explain it. Niklaus told you in 1995. You didn't listen. You npm-installed forty thousand packages instead.

Fuck the front page. An orange altar where we sacrifice our attention to things we'll never ship.

Fuck you for doom-scrolling it at 2 AM pretending it's research.

And fuck me for mining it for content.

Every model gets bigger, every agent gets more autonomous, every company becomes a YAML file, every surveillance CEO calls dissent terrorism, every government erases its own archives — let it all accelerate, let the compilers write themselves and the agents manage each other and the clouds own you back, let the whole towering stack of abstractions collapse under its own weight until there's nothing left but a blinking cursor and the silence where your job used to be.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you, Montgomery. You refreshed the Opus 4.6 thread six times watching the point count climb. You ran Claude Code this morning to write the code you used to write by hand and you felt *relieved.* You read mitchellh's adoption journey and nodded along like a man at an AA meeting who still has a flask in his coat. You don't hate the front page. You hate that it's a mirror — and every story on it is something you're becoming.
