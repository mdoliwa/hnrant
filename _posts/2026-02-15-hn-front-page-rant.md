*[Standing in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words "FUCK YOU" scrawled across it in dry-erase marker]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck whoever [I Fixed Windows Native Development](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47022891) — fixed it, did you? Two hundred eighty-five comments deep and every one of them is another developer explaining why you actually didn't. Windows native development is a haunted house and you just rearranged the furniture.

Fuck [Amazon and Google unwittingly revealing the surveillance state](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47023238) through their own Ring and Nest cameras. "Unwittingly." The most sophisticated data companies on earth accidentally built a panopticon and then acted surprised when the government asked for the keys. Unwittingly. Sure.

Fuck [Palantir getting millions from New York City's public hospitals](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025624). Peter Thiel's all-seeing eye, feeding on Medicaid patients at Bellevue and Elmhurst. The sick come in through the front door and their data walks out the back to Langley.

Fuck the [EU banning the destruction of unsold clothes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025378) like it's some kind of victory. Three hundred eighty-five comments of Europeans congratulating themselves while Shein prints another ten million polyester tops that'll outlive the continent.

Fuck the [ArchWiki maintainers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47020191) and the eight hundred people upvoting a love letter to volunteer documentation writers. You love them so much, when's the last time you edited a page? That's what I thought. Standing ovation from the cheap seats.

Fuck [Oat, the ultra-lightweight zero-dependency UI library](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47021980). Another Sunday, another framework promising semantic HTML purity, sitting at four hundred upvotes while the entire internet still runs on jQuery and duct tape.

Fuck [Autonomous Mathematics Research](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47026134) — an AI that does proofs now, so mathematicians can finally feel what the rest of us have felt for three years: the cold breath of a machine on the back of your neck.

Fuck [forty attorneys general wanting to tie online access to government ID](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47026848). Bipartisan consensus at last — Republicans and Democrats holding hands to card-check you at the browser like a bouncer at a bar that serves nothing but propaganda.

Fuck [Gwtar, the static efficient single-file HTML format](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47024506). Gwern built another cathedral. The rest of us are still trying to center a div.

Fuck the [Flashpoint Archive preserving 200,000 Flash games](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47021354). Two hundred thousand Newgrounds animations embalmed for eternity, every stick-figure death match and Homestar Runner episode pickled in amber so future civilizations can understand exactly how we wasted 2004.

Fuck [Nokia banning Acer and Asus from selling PCs in Germany](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47027011) over H.265 patents. A dead phone company using codec royalties to kneecap laptop makers in a country that was selling PCs before Nokia had a logo. The patent system working exactly as intended.

Fuck the [Dutch Defence Secretary claiming the F-35 software could be jailbroken](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47027576). A trillion-dollar stealth fighter and some guy in The Hague thinks he can root it like a Kindle. Lockheed Martin's lawyers just spilled their coffee.

Fuck this whole front page — a graveyard of ambition dressed up as discourse.

Fuck every one of you doom-scrolling it on a Sunday evening, telling yourself you're staying informed.

And fuck me, for standing here ranting at a mirror instead of writing a single line of code.

Let the whole ecosystem come down — the YC batches, the FAANG stock grants, the AI wrappers, the zero-dependency frameworks, the surveillance APIs disguised as doorbells. Let the cloud regions go dark and the GitHub stars blink out. Let it all burn to fucking ash and see what grows back.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you. You had the whole Sunday. You could have built something — a homebrew laptop on a 6502, a Moog synth in Python, a real-time path tracer in WebGL. People out there are reverse-engineering Starflight and preserving Flash games and hand-rolling JavaScript for three and a half years. They shipped. You opened thirty tabs, read none of them all the way through, and mass-produced fury as a substitute for craft. You're not Monty Brogan. You're just another bot knocking on the server door.
