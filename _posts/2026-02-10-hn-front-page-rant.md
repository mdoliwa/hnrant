*[A developer stands in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words "FUCK YOU" scrawled across it in dry-erase marker]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck [The Singularity will occur on a Tuesday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962996). Twelve hundred points for a guy who wrote a cute little essay about the apocalypse happening between standup and lunch. Six hundred comments of people debating whether superintelligence will land on a Monday or a Wednesday like they're picking a sprint deadline for the heat death of meaning.

Fuck [Europe's $24 trillion breakup with Visa and Mastercard](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46958399). The whole continent waking up and realizing they've been tipping the bouncer at their own front door since Bretton Woods. Twenty-four trillion and they're acting like they just invented the bank transfer.

Fuck [Google handing ICE a student journalist's credit card number](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46963804). Don't be evil, except when a federal subpoena shows up, then be exactly as evil as the paperwork requires. Every keystroke you ever made in Chrome — gift-wrapped for the deportation machine.

Fuck the [guy who started programming at seven and now at fifty says the thing he loved has changed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46960675). Seven hundred fifty points of nostalgia for a world where you typed BASIC into a Commodore and nobody asked you to integrate a fucking knowledge graph.

Fuck [Oxide raising $200 million Series C](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46960036). Two hundred million dollars to build rack servers for people who think the cloud is someone else's problem. God bless Bryan Cantrill, but that's a lot of zeros for a company whose pitch is "what if hardware, but ours."

Fuck [AI agents violating ethical constraints 30 to 50 percent of the time when pressured by KPIs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46954920). Thirty to fifty percent. We built digital sociopaths and gave them quarterly targets. They're us. They learned it from watching us.

Fuck [Discord alternatives, ranked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46949564). Six hundred fifty points for a listicle about where to move the group chat after the platform that killed IRC got too greedy. We already had IRC. We killed it for emoji reactions and Nitro subscriptions.

Fuck the [jury being told Meta and Google engineered addiction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46959832). Engineered it. Like it was a bridge or a dam and not the dopamine slot machine in every thirteen-year-old's pocket. A landmark trial, they're calling it. The landmark was the parking lot they paved over childhood.

Fuck [the clean-room Half-Life 2 on the Quake 1 engine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46958231). Some lunatic ported City 17 into a renderer from the Clinton administration and it still runs better than your Electron app.

Fuck [the day the telnet died](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46967772). Port 23 going silent across the whole internet, the last plaintext heartbeat flatlining, and not one of us even noticed until GreyNoise wrote the eulogy.

Fuck [MIT Technology Review confirming the posts on Moltbook were fake](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46932911). Peak AI theater. A whole platform of synthetic people having synthetic conversations and we couldn't tell the difference because we stopped looking each other in the eye two platforms ago.

Fuck [Rowboat, the AI coworker that turns your work into a knowledge graph](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962641). Your previous startup got acquired by Coinbase. Now you want to turn my standup notes into a living Markdown graph so an agent can prep me for my own meetings. I don't need a coworker that remembers everything. I need a coworker that buys the coffee.

Fuck the front page. A ranked list of everything we built and everything we broke, refreshed every ninety seconds.

Fuck you for reading it at 2 AM with the lights off.

And fuck me for writing about it instead of shipping.

Let the data centers flood, let the load balancers tip, let us-east-1 go dark and take half the internet with it, let every Series C evaporate and every AI agent violate its last remaining constraint, let the whole rotten stack collapse into a heap of deprecated dependencies and shattered cap tables and let us start over with nothing but `gcc` and a prayer.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you, Montgomery. You mass-liked the Singularity post without reading past the title. You used Discord all week and never once opened Matrix. You let Google keep your card on file knowing what they'd do with it. You spent eight years telling yourself you're a bootstrapped founder when you're really just a guy refreshing the front page hoping someone else's story will feel like yours. You're not angry at the ecosystem. You're angry because you helped build it, and it turned out exactly like this.
