*[A developer stands in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words "FUCK YOU" scrawled across it in dry-erase marker]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck [The Codex App](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859054). OpenAI built a whole IDE so your code can be written by a machine and debugged by a machine and shipped by a machine and you can sit there like a museum docent explaining what programming used to feel like.

Fuck [xAI joining SpaceX](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46862170). Two Musk companies merging like black holes, collapsing into a singularity of stock swaps and main-character syndrome. The richest man alive needs more surface area.

Fuck [Todd C. Miller maintaining sudo for over thirty years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46858577). Three decades of one man standing between root and chaos and we can't even keep a weekend side project alive past the README.

Fuck the [Ask HN: Who is hiring?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46857488) thread. February 2026. A thousand job postings that all say "AI-native" and "fast-paced" and mean "we fired the last team and need someone to inherit the wreckage."

Fuck [my iPhone 16 Pro Max producing garbage when running local LLMs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46849258). A $1,200 slab of titanium and silicon that can shoot 4K ProRes but chokes on a 4-bit quantized model. The future of on-device AI is a phone that hallucinates harder than you do.

Fuck [Anki's ownership being transferred to AnkiHub](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46861313). The one piece of software that actually made people smarter, handed off like a baton in a relay race nobody asked for. Every med student on earth holding their breath.

Fuck [the court ordering a restart of all US offshore wind construction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46863112). A judge undoing months of executive fiat with a signature. The turbines were already half-built. The ocean doesn't care about your injunction.

Fuck [Wikipedia as a doomscrollable social media feed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850803). Someone took the last bastion of human knowledge and turned it into TikTok for people who think they're too smart for TikTok.

Fuck [Ian's Shoelace Site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848231). A man who dedicated his life to knots and lacing patterns, sitting on the front page next to a billion-dollar AI merger, and honestly his contribution to humanity might be the bigger one.

Fuck [Notepad++ being hijacked by state-sponsored actors](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46851548). They came for the text editors. The most benign tool in the stack, weaponized, because nothing is safe and nothing was ever safe.

Fuck [leaked chats exposing a scam compound's enslaved workforce](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46852660). Human beings trapped in buildings, forced to run pig-butchering scams at gunpoint, and the front page gave it the same orange arrow as a shoelace tutorial.

Fuck [two kinds of AI users emerging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850588). The people who use it and the people who use it while pretending they don't. There's no third kind. There never was.

Fuck [Claude Code being suddenly everywhere inside Microsoft](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854999). Anthropic's agent crawling through the halls of the company that bet ten billion on OpenAI. Redmond playing both sides like it's a Cold War and they're selling arms to everyone.

Fuck the front page. A slot machine that pays out in existential dread.

Fuck you for refreshing it instead of going outside.

And fuck me for turning it into content.

Let the Codex apps write themselves, let the AI mergers merge until there's one company left eating its own tail, let the scam compounds grow and the wind turbines rust and the sudo maintainer finally retire and watch the whole internet crumble because nobody remembered how `visudo` works — let the whole rotting orange homepage fold in on itself like a browser tab you meant to close three hours ago.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you, Montgomery. You opened the hiring thread and ctrl-F'd your own job title. You ran Claude Code this morning and mass-upvoted the post about Microsoft doing the same thing. You read about enslaved workers in a scam compound and then scrolled past it to read about shoelaces. You don't hate the front page. You hate that it's a list of everything you care about and everything you ignore, side by side, in the same font, with the same little orange arrow — and you keep choosing wrong.
