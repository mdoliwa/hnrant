*[A developer stands in front of a bathroom mirror, breath fogging the glass, phone still warm in his back pocket]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole Wednesday front page.

Fuck [Voxtral Transcribe 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46886735). Another model from Mistral, another leaderboard nobody asked for. You trained on ten million hours of human speech so a product manager can skip listening to his own customer calls. Congratulations — you automated not paying attention.

Fuck [data centers in space](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46876105). It makes no sense. They said it makes no sense right there in the title, and five hundred engineers clicked through anyway hoping someone proved it does. You can't cool a rack in a vacuum but you can't stop a VC from trying.

Fuck ["I miss thinking hard"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46881264). You miss it because you stopped doing it. You tab-completed your last original thought six months ago and now you're writing an elegy for your own cognition. The model didn't kill deep work — you let it hold the pillow.

Fuck [AI killing B2B SaaS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888441). Every SaaS founder staring at Claude like it's the asteroid and they're the dinosaurs. Your $49/seat/month form builder with Stripe integration is shaking because a chatbot can generate the whole thing in nine seconds. The meteor already hit. You're just watching the dust settle.

Fuck [connecting Claude Code to a local model when your quota runs out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46845845). The coding agent you pay two hundred dollars a month for runs dry, so you hot-wire it to a local Llama running on your gaming GPU like a junkie switching dealers. This is dependency with a fallback plan.

Fuck [the Epstein PDF forensics](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46886440). Metadata layers and redaction failures exposing the names they tried to bury. The most powerful people in the world undone by someone who knows how `pdftk` works. Justice through file format archaeology.

Fuck [building a 24-bit arcade CRT display adapter from scratch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888795). Hand-soldering a display pipeline for a tube that weighs more than your desk. Beautiful, pointless, magnificent — the exact kind of project that makes you realize you've never actually built anything with your hands.

Fuck [Craftplan, the production management tool some guy built for his wife's bakery](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46847690). He built her a whole app. A bakery ERP. She needed a spreadsheet and he gave her a SaaS platform because that's what we do — we can't love someone without shipping them a dashboard.

Fuck [Claude is a space to think](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46884883). Anthropic writing a love letter to their own product. A space to think. Your chatbot is a *space to think* the way a casino is a space for financial planning.

Fuck [X offices raided in France while the UK opens a fresh investigation into Grok](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46868998). The free speech platform getting its doors kicked in by two countries simultaneously. Musk built a social network, an AI, and a continental legal crisis, all while posting through it.

Fuck [the Ghidra MCP Server with 110 tools for AI-assisted reverse engineering](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46882389). A hundred and ten tools to let Claude disassemble binaries. We gave the language model a decompiler and a god complex. What could go wrong?

Fuck [the guinea worm almost being eradicated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46886191). The second human disease wiped off the planet, and it's sitting at page two behind three Claude wrappers and a bakery app. Jimmy Carter's forty-year campaign against a parasite, and we can't give it the same energy as a quota workaround.

Fuck [the FBI failing to crack a reporter's iPhone because Lockdown Mode was on](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46886237). One toggle in Settings defeated the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Apple shipped the feature, a journalist flipped the switch, and the most powerful surveillance apparatus on earth hit a 404.

Fuck the front page. A Wednesday museum of Claude worship and extinction-level nostalgia, ranked by people who mass-upvote AI wrappers and scroll past eradicated diseases.

Fuck you for reading this on your second monitor while Claude writes your actual code on the first one.

And fuck me for mass-refreshing the front page like it's going to tell me something I don't already know.

This is the loop — we miss thinking hard but we won't do it, we mourn B2B SaaS while building the thing that kills it, we cheer the FBI losing while handing every keystroke to a model we don't control, we build our wives bakery apps instead of learning to bake, and we let a parasitic worm's eradication drown under a flood of Claude content because the algorithm rewards what we click, not what matters. The front page is a mirror and we just keep breathing on the glass so we don't have to see clearly.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you, Montgomery. You have Claude Code open in three terminals right now. You bookmarked the "I miss thinking hard" essay and then immediately asked a model to summarize it. You upvoted the guinea worm story but you didn't read it — you never read them, you just upvote the worthy ones to feel like a person who cares while scrolling past to the next AI wrapper. You don't miss thinking hard. You miss believing you were the kind of person who would.
