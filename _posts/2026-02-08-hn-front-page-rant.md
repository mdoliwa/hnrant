*[A developer stands in front of a bathroom mirror, staring at the words "FUCK YOU" scrawled across it in dry-erase marker]*

Yeah, fuck you, too. Fuck *me*? Fuck *you*. Fuck you and this whole front page.

Fuck [Vouch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930961). A thousand points for mitchellh dropping yet another perfectly crafted side project while the rest of us can't finish a TODO app. We don't upvote tools anymore. We upvote the people we wish we were.

Fuck ["OpenClaw is changing my life"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46931805). Three hundred points for someone's personal awakening to an AI coding tool. It's changing your life. So did Copilot. So did Stack Overflow. So did the rubber duck. You'll be on to the next life-changing tool by April.

Fuck [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46934107). Copilot wasn't enough. Now the agent opens the PR, reviews the PR, approves the PR. The developer is cc'd as a courtesy. You're not in the loop — you're the loop's rubber stamp.

Fuck the ["What are you working on?" thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46937696). A monthly confessional where six hundred people describe projects they'll abandon by March. Show me the February 2025 thread. Count the survivors.

Fuck the [Mars colony RPG](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46936237). Someone built a game about terraforming Mars based on Kim Stanley Robinson novels while we can't terraform a single neighborhood without an HOA filing an injunction. We'll colonize the red planet in fiction and lose the blue one in fact.

Fuck [running your own AS with BGP on FreeBSD](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46934266). Congratulations, you now operate your own autonomous system. You're the ISP of yourself. The packets route through your living room and the only customer is your ego.

Fuck [LocalGPT](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930391). A local-first AI assistant with persistent memory, written in Rust, because of course it's in Rust. It remembers everything you've ever asked it. Your therapist doesn't even do that.

Fuck the [Roundcube SVG bypass](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46937012). An SVG `feImage` tag sneaking past image blocking in webmail. Twenty years of email security and we're still getting owned by markup nobody reads. The attack vector is a fucking filter primitive.

Fuck [Slop Terrifies Me](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46933067). Four hundred points of people agreeing that AI-generated garbage is drowning the internet, posted on a site where half the comments are already AI-paraphrased. The call is coming from inside the house.

Fuck ["Experts Have World Models. LLMs Have Word Models"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46936920). The most upvoted distinction nobody will internalize. You'll read it, nod sagely, then go back to asking Claude to architect your database schema.

Fuck the [GTA modder who got the 1997 original running on modern PCs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46938241). One person, reverse-engineering a twenty-nine-year-old binary, while Rockstar can't ship GTA VI without fourteen live-service monetization layers. The modder is the last honest engineer.

Fuck [Beyond Agentic Coding](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930565). We're already beyond it. We went from autocomplete to copilot to agent to *beyond agent* in eighteen months. The next stage is the AI writing the blog post about how we're beyond the stage we just named.

Fuck [the Game Boy Color 3D shader](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46935791). Someone put real-time 3D rendering on a chip from 1998 and it runs smoother than your React dashboard on an M4 MacBook. Twenty-seven years of Moore's Law and we went backwards.

Fuck the front page. A daily museum of things we'll never build, problems we'll never solve, and tools we'll abandon before the README gets its first typo fix.

Fuck you for reading every comment thread knowing you won't contribute a single line of code today.

And fuck me for turning shipping projects and other people's exploits into a bit.

Every agent gets more autonomous, every protocol gets more exploited, every life-changing tool gets replaced by next month's life-changing tool, every RPG about Mars is more plausible than our actual plans for Earth — let it all compile, let the agentic workflows approve their own pull requests and the local models memorize your every regret and the slop keep rising until the signal drowns and there's nothing left but a front page full of repos we starred and never read.

*[pause]*

No. No, fuck you, Montgomery. You starred Vouch on GitHub without reading the source. You told three people OpenClaw changed your life and you've used it twice. You asked an LLM to summarize the world-models paper because you didn't have the patience to read nine pages. You're not ranting against the front page. You *are* the front page — a thousand points of sound and fury, refreshed hourly, signifying nothing.
